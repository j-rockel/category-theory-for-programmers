# Chapter 5

**1. Show that the terminal object is unique up to unique isomorphism.**

**2. What is a product of two objects in a poset? Hint: Use the universal construction.**

**3. What is a coproduct of two objects in a poset?**

**4. Implement the equivalent of Haskell `Either` as a generic type in your favorite language (other than Haskell).**

**5. Show that `Either` is a "better" coproduct than `int` equipped with two injections:**
``` C++
int i(int n) { return n; }

int j(bool b) { return b ? 0: 1; }
```

**6. Continuing the previous problem: How would you argue that `int` with the two injections `i` and `j` cannot be "better" than `Either`.**

**7. Still continuing: What about these injections:**
``` C++
int i(int n) {
  if (n < 0) return n;
  return n + 2;
}

int j(bool b) { return b ? 0: 1; }
```


**8. Come up with an inferior candidate for a coproduct of `int` and `bool` that cannot be better than `Either` because it allows multiple acceptable morphisms from it to `Either`.**
